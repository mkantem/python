# python

This repository holds various files that are part of small projects as an introduction to Python language. They are organize in topics gradually seen during my lectures.  

In-Comment texts are in **French** to conform with the instruction language of the unit.

Files are organized in directories with concept-name format, indicating the focus and learning objective of the folder.

In case you have found something wrong and would like to fix it or point it out use the GitHub Issues or Pull Requests ;)
